# My Portfolio Project

This project is a portfolio website developed using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, with the design created in **Figma**. The goal is to showcase skills, experience, and projects in a visually appealing and responsive layout.

## Project Overview

The portfolio aims to deliver a professional and interactive platform that highlights my work and skills. The design process began in Figma, starting from wireframes to ensure a consistent structure across desktop, tablet, and mobile views, followed by high-fidelity designs.

## Objectives

1. **Design**: Create a comprehensive portfolio layout in Figma, starting with wireframes and then refining designs for desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints.
2. **Development**: Build the portfolio using React and Tailwind CSS for efficient and scalable styling.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the website is fully responsive and matches the Figma design specifications.
4. **Code Optimization**: Apply the **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to maintain clean, reusable code.
5. **Data Management**: Use JSON files as placeholders for backend data, simulating dynamic content.
6. **Dashboard**: Develop an interactive dashboard to display key information and metrics.
